                    We study a transititive distillation procedure to distill small-scale document transformers for
                    specific document types and tasks. Our key focus is SlimDoc (right, blue), a feature-based
                    distillation procedure for document transformers that focuses on distilling hidden states,
                    attentions and output logits at different stages of training. To apply SlimDoc in unsupervised
                    settings, we preceed it with a label distillation from labels generated with an LLM (red, left)

                            Deploying state-of-the-art document understanding models remains resource-intensive and
                            impractical in
                            many real-world scenarios, particularly where labeled data is scarce and computational
                            budgets
                            are constrained. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel approach towards
                            parameter-efficient document understanding models capable of adapting to specific tasks and
                            document types
                            without the need for labeled data. Specifically, we propose an approach coined SlimDoc to
                            distill
                            multimodal document transformer encoder models into smaller student models, using internal
                            signals at
                            different training stages, followed by external signals. Our approach is inspired by
                            TinyBERT and adapted
                            to the domain of document understanding transformers. We demonstrate SlimDoc to out-
                            perform both a single-stage distillation and a direct fine-tuning of the student.
                            Experimental results
                            across six document understanding datasets demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness: Our
                            distilled
                            student models achieve on average 93.0% of the teacher’s performance, while the fine-tuned
                            students
                            achieve 87.0% of the teacher’s performance. Without requiring any labeled data, we create
                            a compact student which achieves 96.0% of the performance of its supervised-distilled
                            counterpart and
                            86.2% of the performance of a supervised-fine-tuned teacher model. We demonstrate our
                            distil-
                            lation approach to pick up on document geometry and to be effective on the two popular
                            document
                            understanding models LiLT and LayoutLMv3. Our implementation and training data is available

                            Overview of our distillation approach <em>SlimDoc</em>: Distillation of the student model
                            with <em>M</em> transformer layers from a teacher model with <em>N</em> layers is split into
                            two phases: in the first phase, embeddings, attention scores and hidden states of the text
                            flow from the student model are aligned with the teacher model using MSE loss. In the second
                            phase, the student model's logits are aligned with the teacher model's using KL divergence
                            loss.

                        <p>We fine-tune the teacher using Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for three tasks: extractive VQA, SER,
                            and KIE. For VQA, the model predicts start and end positions in a sequence
                            <code>x = x₁,…,xₙ</code>. It outputs probabilities <code>pˢ(x)</code> and
                            <code>pᵉ(x)</code>, where <code>pˢ(x)ᵢ</code> and <code>pᵉ(x)ᵢ</code> are the probabilities
                            of token <code>i</code> being the start or end. The loss is:
                            <code>ℒ<sub>CE,QA</sub> = - [log(pˢ(x)<sub>yₛ</sub>) + log(pᵉ(x)<sub>yₑ</sub>)]</code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>For SER and KIE, each token is classified into one of <code>C</code> classes. The model
                            outputs <code>p(x)ᵢʲ</code>, the probability of token <code>i</code> being class
                            <code>j</code>. The CE loss is:
                            <code>ℒ<sub>CE,SER+KIE</sub> = - (1/n) ∑₁ⁿ log(p(x)ᵢ<sup>yᵢ</sup>)</code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>To distill a student from the teacher, we use our method <i>SlimDoc</i>, split into two
                            phases. In phase one, we align internal signals using MSE loss. For hidden states:
                            <code>ℒ<sub>hidden</sub> = (1/M) ∑₁^M MSE(H<sub>𝒮</sub>ⁱ(x), H<sub>𝒯</sub><sup>lᵢ</sup>(x))</code>,
                            with
                            <code>MSE = (1/dn) ∑ⱼ=1ⁿ ∑ₖ=1ᵈ (H<sub>𝒮,jk</sub>ⁱ - H<sub>𝒯,jk</sub><sup>lᵢ</sup>)²</code>.
                            The embedding loss is
                            <code>ℒ<sub>emb</sub> = MSE(H<sub>𝒮</sub>⁰(x), H<sub>𝒯</sub>⁰(x))</code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>For attention (shape <code>H × n × n</code>):
                            <code>ℒ<sub>attn</sub> = (1/M) ∑₁^M MSE(A<sub>𝒮</sub>ⁱ(x), A<sub>𝒯</sub><sup>lᵢ</sup>(x))</code>,
                            with
                            <code>MSE = (1/Hn²) ∑ₕ=1ᴴ ∑ⱼ=1ⁿ ∑ₖ=1ⁿ (A<sub>𝒮,hjk</sub>ⁱ - A<sub>𝒯,hjk</sub><sup>lᵢ</sup>)²</code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Combined distillation loss is
                            <code>ℒ<sub>distill</sub> = α · ℒ<sub>emb</sub> + β · ℒ<sub>hidden</sub> + γ · ℒ<sub>attn</sub></code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>In phase two, we align the model outputs using KL divergence:
                            <code>ℒ<sub>KL</sub> = (1/nC) ∑ⱼ=1ⁿ ∑ₖ=1ᶜ p<sub>𝒮</sub>(x)<sub>jk</sub> · log(p<sub>𝒮</sub>(x)<sub>jk</sub> / p<sub>𝒯</sub>(x)<sub>jk</sub>)</code>.
                            For VQA, this is applied separately to start and end outputs.
                        </p>

                        <p>General and vocabulary-specific results. The upper half compares our distilled students (DT)
                            to the teacher models and fine-tuned students (FT), where <strong>best student results are
                                shown in bold.</strong> It shows that the distillation procedure provides an advantage
                            compared to regular fine-tuning: the distilled 4-layer student models achieve on average
                            93.4% and 92.5% of the performance of the 12-layer teachers for LiLT and LayoutLMv3,
                            respectively, while the fine-tuned students only achieve 87.3% and 86.6%. Further, the data
                            indicates that an explicit distillation of layout signals is not necessary for LiLT, as the
                            LiLT-Layout adaptation is on par with the distillation of LiLT's text-flow, which captures
                            layout signals via the BiACM mechanism. Furthermore, it can be observed that omission of
                            layout signals during training leads to a sharp drop in performance (LiLT-NoLayout,
                            LayoutLMv3-NoVisionNoLayout) and that our approach implicitly distills layout signals.</p>

                        <p>The lower half evaluates different vocabulary sizes for the student models: the
                            <strong>full</strong> vocabulary with 50k tokens is compared against the
                            <strong>small</strong> variant with 15k tokens and the <strong><em>tiny</em></strong>
                            variant with 5k tokens. <strong>Best student results for <span
                                    style="text-transform:uppercase;">small</span> vocab are shown in bold</strong> and
                            <strong><em>best student results for <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">tiny</span>
                                    vocab are shown in bold and italics</em></strong>. Column <em>Comp.</em> shows
                            relative performance compared to full-size vocabulary students in percent. The results
                            suggest that reducing vocabulary size is an efficient approach to decreasing model size,
                            having only a moderate impact on performance: on average, the distilled student with the
                            <strong>small</strong> vocabulary variant achieves 97.7% and 98.0% of the performance of
                            distilled student with the <strong>full</strong> vocabulary for LiLT and LayoutLMv3,
                            respectively.

                            Results of our ablation studies, where we use a single-phase distillation (DT-1Phase)
                            compared to our usual two-phase setup (DT) and fine-tune a student model initialized with
                            the weights of the pre-trained base model (FT-NewInit) instead of the fine-tuned teacher
                            (FT). <strong>Best student results are shown in bold.</strong> The results suggest that the
                            two-phase distillation setup provides an advantage compared to distillation of hidden
                            states, attention scores and logits together, leading to improvements of up to 2.5 pp.
                            Further, the data demonstrates that the initialization of the student model's weights plays
                            a crucial role in the learning process, with the teacher-initialized student model achieving
                            better scores on all datasets.

                            The results indicate that the middle layers of these models benefit more from distillation

                            Overview of model size and inference times for teacher and student models. Inference time is
                            measured on 100 batches of DocVQA for batch size 16 (column <em>Inf. (ms)</em>). Column
                            <em>D.s.</em> indicates the downscaling factor by comparing the size of the teacher to the
                            student. SV and TV denote the <strong>small</strong> and <strong>tiny</strong> vocabulary
                            variants, respectively. Column <em>Best Avg Score</em> shows the best average score across
                            all datasets achieved by an n-layer student. <strong>Best student metrics are shown in
                                bold.</strong> It is shown that even the largest student models with 4 layers reach
                            considerable improvements in model size and inference time, while maintaining a performance
                            close to that of the teacher. While both downscaling strategies—vocabulary reduction and
                            layer reduction—produce smaller models, reducing the number of layers below 4 leads to a
                            more significant performance drop, whereas vocabulary reduction more effectively preserves
                            accuracy at comparable model sizes.

                        <p>
                            In this work we present SlimDoc, a novel and effective distillation framework for
                            compressing
                            multimodal document transformer models into lightweight, task-specific students without
                            requiring labeled data. By combining feature-based and output-based distillation across two
                            stages, SlimDoc achieves strong performance retention while significantly reducing model
                            size and computational costs. Evaluations across six datasets and multiple transformer
                            backbones confirm that our approach consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning,
                            maintains spatial layout awareness, and operates effectively even with LLM-generated
                            silver-standard labels. Additionally, we demonstrate that vocabulary pruning and strategic
                            layer selection further enhance efficiency with minimal performance trade-off. SlimDoc paves
                            the way for scalable and label-efficient deployment of document understanding models in
                            real-world, resource-constrained environments.
